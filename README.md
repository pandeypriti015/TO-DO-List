# TO_DO_List

This is a fully functional TO DO list.

Anyone can add the items to the list.

This application has only frontend and works fine.

Installation:

Clone this Repo:

https://github.com/pandeypriti015/TO_DO_List.git

Get inside the to_do folder:

cd to_do
Start the application:

npm start
Using redux I have mainted my state in another folder. To check that implementation: Get into to-do-list folder:

cd to_do
Start the application:

npm start
I hope you liked this application.
